TO-DO-LIST:
This Python code uses the Tkinter library to create a simple To-Do List application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The application window contains two sections: one for adding tasks and another for displaying a list of tasks.

The GUI includes labels, buttons, and text entry fields. The "Add task" section allows users to input tasks in a text box, and the entered tasks are displayed in a list on the right side of the window. Users can add tasks by clicking the "Add" button. The application also supports deleting tasks from the list using the "Delete" button.

Tasks are stored in a file named 'data.txt', and the program reads from and writes to this file to maintain a persistent list of tasks even after the application is closed and reopened.

Overall, this code provides a basic To-Do List application with a straightforward interface for adding and deleting tasks.


CACULATOR:

This Python code uses the Tkinter library to create a simple calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes buttons for digits 0-9, operators (+, -, *, /), parentheses, clear (C), and equals (=). The calculator's input and output are displayed in a text box. Users can click on the buttons to input numbers and operations, and the calculator evaluates the expression and displays the result when the "=" button is pressed. If there is an error in the expression, it shows an "Error" message. The GUI layout is organized using rows and columns to arrange the buttons and text box.

ROCKPAPERSCISSORS:

This program is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the Tkinter library in Python. The game has a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons for the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer randomly selects its choice. After the player makes a choice, the program compares it with the computer's choice and determines the winner based on predefined rules. The scores for the player and the computer are displayed on the screen, along with the choices made and the outcome of each round. The player can continue playing by clicking the buttons, and the scores are updated accordingly.
