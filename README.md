TO-DO-LIST:
This Python code uses the Tkinter library to create a simple To-Do List application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The application window contains two sections: one for adding tasks and another for displaying a list of tasks.

The GUI includes labels, buttons, and text entry fields. The "Add task" section allows users to input tasks in a text box, and the entered tasks are displayed in a list on the right side of the window. Users can add tasks by clicking the "Add" button. The application also supports deleting tasks from the list using the "Delete" button.

Tasks are stored in a file named 'data.txt', and the program reads from and writes to this file to maintain a persistent list of tasks even after the application is closed and reopened.

Overall, this code provides a basic To-Do List application with a straightforward interface for adding and deleting tasks.


CACULATOR:

This Python code uses the Tkinter library to create a simple calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes buttons for digits 0-9, operators (+, -, *, /), parentheses, clear (C), and equals (=). The calculator's input and output are displayed in a text box. Users can click on the buttons to input numbers and operations, and the calculator evaluates the expression and displays the result when the "=" button is pressed. If there is an error in the expression, it shows an "Error" message. The GUI layout is organized using rows and columns to arrange the buttons and text box.

ROCKPAPERSCISSORS:

This program is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the Tkinter library in Python. The game has a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons for the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer randomly selects its choice. After the player makes a choice, the program compares it with the computer's choice and determines the winner based on predefined rules. The scores for the player and the computer are displayed on the screen, along with the choices made and the outcome of each round. The player can continue playing by clicking the buttons, and the scores are updated accordingly.

PASSWORD GENERATOR:

This code is a simple password generator program using the Tkinter library in Python. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with an entry field for the user to input the desired password length. Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the program generates a random password of the specified length, consisting of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The generated password is displayed in another entry field. If the user enters an invalid password length (zero or negative), an error message is shown using a pop-up messagebox. The GUI is clean and straightforward, making it easy for users to generate secure passwords with a specified length.

CONTACT BOOK:

This program is a simple contact book application created using the Tkinter library in Python. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with entry fields for the user to input contact names and phone numbers. It includes a listbox that displays the names of the saved contacts. Users can add new contacts, delete existing ones, and select contacts from the list to view and edit their details.

The main features of the program include:

Add Contact: Users can input a name and phone number in the provided entry fields and click the "Add Contact" button to save the contact. A warning message is displayed if either the name or phone number is missing.

Delete Contact: Users can select a contact from the list and click the "Delete Contact" button to remove it from the contact book. A warning message is displayed if no contact is selected.

Listbox Display: The listbox dynamically displays the names of the saved contacts, allowing users to see their contact list at a glance.

Contact Selection: When a contact is selected from the list, the corresponding name and phone number are displayed in the entry fields, allowing users to edit or review the contact details.

The program promotes a user-friendly experience with clear labels, entry fields, buttons, and listbox interactions. It serves as a basic example of how to create a simple contact book application using Tkinter.
