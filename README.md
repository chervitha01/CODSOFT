TO-DO-LIST:
This Python code uses the Tkinter library to create a simple To-Do List application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The application window contains two sections: one for adding tasks and another for displaying a list of tasks.

The GUI includes labels, buttons, and text entry fields. The "Add task" section allows users to input tasks in a text box, and the entered tasks are displayed in a list on the right side of the window. Users can add tasks by clicking the "Add" button. The application also supports deleting tasks from the list using the "Delete" button.

Tasks are stored in a file named 'data.txt', and the program reads from and writes to this file to maintain a persistent list of tasks even after the application is closed and reopened.

Overall, this code provides a basic To-Do List application with a straightforward interface for adding and deleting tasks.
